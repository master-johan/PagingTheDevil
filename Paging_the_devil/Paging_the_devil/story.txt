Greetings young adventures !@
@
After hundreds of years of war and agony for the human race@
@
God decided that it had been enough of evil on earth@
@
So God made a pact with the devil and sent him on a never ending vacation@
@
And so with his almighty power@
@
God made earth the utopia that never before had been possible@
@
But what happened to humanity was something he did not forsee, @
@
People stopped living and stopped caring about things.@
@
It was clear that without sadness there can be no happiness.@
@
Without pain and suffering there would be no pleasure.@
@
God realised his mistake and tried to page the devil@
@
But the Devil did not answer@
@
My young travelers it's now up to you to set everything right@
@
Your mission is to travel where no other man has dared travel@
@
You will face many horrors in your journey to the devils office.@
@
So put on some sunblock and bring a bucket of water@
@
Because this is going to be a flammable mission@
@
Are you ready to turn down the heat?@
